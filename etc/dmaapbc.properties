# regarding password encryption:
# In the dependencies that Maven retrieves (e.g., under dcae_dmaapbc/target/deps/ is a jar file cadi-core-version.jar.  Generate the key file with:
#
# java \u2013jar wherever/cadi-core-*.jar keygen keyfilename
# chmod 400 keyfilename
#
# To encrypt a key:
#
# java \u2013jar wherever/cadi-core-*.jar digest password-to-encrypt keyfilename
#
# This will generate a string.  Put \u201Cenc:\u201D on the front of the string, and put the result in this properties file.
